# Image-Classification
The "Image Classification for Sad and Happy Faces" project develops a model to classify facial expressions as sad or happy using TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.
Project is centered around creating an advanced model capable of automatically detecting and classifying facial expressions as either sad or happy. The project leverages deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch to build a robust system that can identify intricate patterns and features indicative of distinct emotional states.
